## Introduction
Almost all websites want to provide at least one method to allow visitors to get in touch with them. The most common options they provide are physical addresses, telephone numbers, social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc), email addresses, online chat with an advisor, online chat with a robot, and a contact form.      

Visitors can often have many options available to contact the people behind the website. Sometimes a phone number is the best option if they need real-time assistance, or social media if they what the communication to be public. Other times they may physically want to visit the place of business, so the address is perfect. However, often a contact form is used when none of the other communication methods are possible, available, or appropriate.      

From the website users' point of view, a contact form allows them to provide details which they may find harder to explain over a phone, or they may feel more comfortable writing than talking. Often phone numbers are busy or closed, so sending a message through a contact form is quick and easy.    

From a website owners' point of view, a contact form allows them to require enough information (for example, their name, email address, and reason for contact) to deal with the message. It also allows for a digital paper trail and future potential marketing.
